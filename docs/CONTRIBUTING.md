## üîÑ Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

### 2. Make Changes

- Follow coding standards (see below)
- Add tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed
- Keep commits focused and atomic

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test              # Frontend
python -m pytest      # Backend

# Run linters
npm run lint          # Frontend
flake8 .              # Backend
```

## üíª Coding Standards

### Python (Backend)

**Style Guide:** PEP 8

```python
# Good
def calculate_net_worth(assets, liabilities):
    """Calculate net worth from assets and liabilities.
    
    Args:
        assets (list): List of asset dictionaries
        liabilities (list): List of liability dictionaries
        
    Returns:
        float: Net worth value
    """
    total_assets = sum(asset['amount'] for asset in assets)
    total_liabilities = sum(liability['amount'] for liability in liabilities)
    return total_assets - total_liabilities

# Bad
def calc(a, l):
    return sum([x['amount'] for x in a]) - sum([y['amount'] for y in l])
```

**Key Principles:**

- Use descriptive variable names
- Add docstrings to functions
- Follow PEP 8 for formatting
- Keep functions small and focused
- Handle errors gracefully

**Linting:**

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install flake8 black isort

# Format code
black .
isort .

# Check style
flake8 .
```

### JavaScript/React (Frontend)

**Style Guide:** Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide

```javascript
// Good
const AssetCard = ({ asset, onUpdate }) => {
  const [isEditing, setIsEditing] = useState(false);
  
  const handleSave = async () => {
    try {
      await updateAsset(asset.id, updatedData);
      onUpdate();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to update asset:', error);
    }
  };
  
  return (
    <div className="asset-card">
      {/* Component JSX */}
    </div>
  );
};

// Bad
function card(a, u) {
  const [e, sE] = useState(false);
  return <div>{a.name}</div>;
}
```

**Key Principles:**

- Use functional components with hooks
- Prop-types or TypeScript for type checking
- Meaningful component and variable names
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use const for constants, let for variables

**Linting:**

```bash
# Format code
npm run format

# Check style
npm run lint
```

### CSS/Tailwind

```html
<!-- Good: Semantic class names, consistent spacing -->
<div className="flex flex-col gap-4 p-6 bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Asset Details</h2>
  <p className="text-gray-600">Description text</p>
</div>

<!-- Bad: Inconsistent, hard to maintain -->
<div className="flex gap-2 p-2" style="background: white">
  <h2 className="text-xl">Asset</h2>
</div>
```
